# vue-cli + json2typescript

Project created to check status of bug reported to the Nuxt.js project

Using the json2typescript library, the HelloWorld component intializes a object, then creates an instance of Obj. To prove that an instance was created, it calls a function from a subobject.

To reproduce, run `npm install` then `npm run serve`. Visit http://localhost:8080 then view the console.

When this code is run in a bare Nuxt project, the conversion fails with a generic error from the library.
